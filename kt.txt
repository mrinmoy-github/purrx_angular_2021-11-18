products/. products is live .
2) Images are changed , check once if images are changing on each products or not
3) At this moment , you have to change the text , for each product
4) Follow the Product name , and find the corresponding it from the above . For eg :- CB Doze = 56
5) On the right hand side , From the title of the product till the button Add To bag, is coming from Admin

from page. That is , it  is dynamic from the page.
